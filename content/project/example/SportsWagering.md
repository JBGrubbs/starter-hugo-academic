Sports wagering has increased in recent years and there are compelling reasons to expect that it will continue to increase in coming years, particularly among younger generations. This is due, in part, to both recent legal judgments (i.e., Murphy v. NCAA) and technological advances around sports-wagering behaviors, such as the increase in daily fantasy sports. Accordingly, the overarching theme of the present work is to study the trajectory of sports wagering over time in the U.S., establish general norms for the motivations and cognitions underlying such behaviors, determine risk factors for developing disordered sports-wagering behaviors (i.e., gambling disorder), and assess how technology is facilitating sports-wagering behavior.
