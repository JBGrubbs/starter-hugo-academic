The primary purpose of the GOVET project is to expand the systematic study of gambling disorder by leveraging the five decade history of the Gambling Treatment Program at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, under the leadership of Heather Chapman, Ph.D. 
The primary aims of this work are as follows.
1.	To aggregate and evaluate approximately five decades of treatment data collected by the Gambling Treatment Program (GTP) at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center (LSCDVAMC) and compile it into an accessible and analyzable database.
2.	To establish a clinical profile of veterans with severe gambling related problems.
3.	To establish risk factors for the development of gambling related problems in veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces.
4.	To describe clinical data among severe gamblers within the greater context of gamblers in general and veterans in the community (i.e., those receiving inpatient treatment through the GTP at the LSCDVAMC).
5.	To describe individual difference and therapeutic variables associated with recovery for veterans with gambling disorder.
